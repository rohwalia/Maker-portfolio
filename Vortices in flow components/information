In the folder you can see the folder "Vortex frequency" which contains Python files showing different stages of my smooth pipe flow theory. In the end I decided to use CFD.
Hence, I used a different simulation which is in the "Parameters" folder. Here there are Pyhton files simulating the dependence of the angular velocity needed to achieve this
whistling phenomenon depending on different parameters (radius, length, corrugation width).

In the "Resonance frequency" folder there are Pyhton scripts which output the dependance of the resonant frequency of the component again on different parameters (radius, length,
corrugation width). The folder "Panzer pipes" contain the same as the "Parameters" folder only for a component where the material and corrugation shape was different from my normal 
experimental series. This was just to test the theory limits.

The folder "Doppler" contains a Python file simulating the Doppler effect observed when the whistling phenomenon occurs and the viewer is not on the rotational axis of the
component. Files in "Flow over corrugation" are just a failed attempt to approximate the corrugations as a series of diffusers and compressors. After that I used CFD. The 
simulation results are then in excel files in "Output".

You can also see the Arduino code I used for the blowing setup in the folder "sound_tube_control_code".
